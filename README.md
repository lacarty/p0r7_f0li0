### Summary of Steps 

_ Watch this walk through video:  https://youtu.be/P2Y9W29kcjs

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project. 
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [ ] Push commits: `git push origin <####>`.

### Follow these steps to download your template and start the project:

- [ ] Navigate here: [https://html5up.net/](https://html5up.net/)
- [ ] Some good choices for a portfolio:
	- [https://html5up.net/story](https://html5up.net/story)
	- [https://html5up.net/solid-state](https://html5up.net/solid-state)
	- [https://html5up.net/miniport](https://html5up.net/miniport)
	- [https://html5up.net/dimension](https://html5up.net/dimension)

- [ ] Unzip the code and copy the site to your git repository that you just set up
  * Note that we won't be utilizing the pre processed CSS structure, you can just ignore any folder with LESS or SASS (SCSS) in it.

- [ ] Customize the template to you 
	- [ ] Update the title tag match your name
	- [ ] Update the place holder content throughout the template to your information
		* Some templates are much larger than others, you don't need to fill in every little div with information, just try to get the site representing you and your work 
		* You can use sites like [https://www.pexels.com/](https://www.pexels.com/)  or (https://unsplash.com/) for free images to fill in place holders
		* Showcase projects you have worked on by providing some information and links to your git hub projects
- [ ] Implement proper attribution: Attribution is required under the [creative commons license](https://html5up.net/license) that came with the website files you downloaded.  Be sure to provide attribution somewhere in the site.  The templates should already come with attribution found in most footers but double check to be sure.
- [ ] Host your website for the world to see. Follow the instructions found here [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/).  Once you have hosted your web page, share it for your peers to see.  This is not a small feat!
